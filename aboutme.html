<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>My name is Fletcher Petersen. My student number is s3886293 and my email is s3886293@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Wagga Wagga NSW. I was born on the 25th of August 2000 have lived in Wagga ever since. I graduated from the Wagga Wagga Christian College in 2018 and have been working at Jaycar electronics since 2017.</p>

<p>Both my parents were born in Australia and have lived in Australia most, if not all of their lives. I only speak English but did learn a bit of Indonesian through school, most of which I have forgotten now.</p>

<p>My favourite sport is basketball. I play a few times a week when the season is running. I have learned to play guitar but don't really play anymore. One of my favourite hobbies/pastimes is gaming</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>Growing up gaming sparked my interest in IT. I have always liked taking the time to notice and think about all the different technologies around me in my everyday life. I like seeing new technologies and how they work together and what that can do for the world and me individually.</p>

<p>I have wanted to study IT for a while but did not know where to start. My brother is studying the same course at RMIT, so he convinced me to apply too. I applied through open universities same as him.</p>

<p>I expect to gain a more in depth understanding of IT and hopefully find what interests me the most about IT. I plan to use this as a steppingstone to finding a career in IT once I know what I like the most.</p>
