					<h2>Day Organiser</h2>

					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>My project idea is a day oragniser application that will be connected to multiple devices. User can enter the times of the day that they are occupied with work, study, sports, or other activities. The app will then not only alert when a person needs to prepare for/do the things they have entered, but also calculate time in between what has been entered for the day that the person has available to do other activities. This is great for people like me who find themselves disorganised and struggling to find time to even make dinner. The app would also periodically remind a person to find time to relax, or if they have a partner to maybe spend a bit of time with that person.</p>

					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>My motivation for this project is to help people like me who are not organised daily. There is a plethora of books, articles and videos created to help people become more organised. My goal for this project is to help people take things day by day, even hour by hour, to find more time in the day to get small things done. I believe focusing on getting small tasks done will make people feel more accomplished and contribute in a big way to them feeling organised. </p>

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p></p>

					<h3>Tool And Technologies</h3>
					<p>The app will need to be programmed and available on smartphones and other devices. I would need to find a suitable programming language to use to develop this app. Also, graphical design will be important for the app to stand out. To have the option of connecting to other apps to increase the capability of the app I would need to use something like IFTTT. Storage of entered data would most likely be internal unless the app is to be able to link with friends and other apps. If that is the case, then cloud storage may be necessary to interlink people and other apps. The app would also obviously have to be published on the app store and google play for it to be available to the consumer.</p>
