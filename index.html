              <h3>Personal Information</h3>

              <p>My name is Fletcher Petersen. My student number is s3886293 and my email is s3886293@student.rmit.edu.au

              I was born and raised in Wagga Wagga NSW. I was born on the 25th of August 2000 have lived in Wagga ever since. I graduated from the Wagga Wagga Christian College in 2018 and have been working at Jaycar electronics since 2017.<br><br>

              Both my parents were born in Australia and have lived in Australia most, if not all of their lives. I only speak English but did learn a bit of Indonesian through school, most of which I have forgotten now.<br><br>

              My favourite sport is basketball. I play a few times a week when the season is running. I have learned to play guitar but don't really play anymore. One of my favourite hobbies/pastimes is gaming</p>

              <h3>Interest in IT</h3>

              <p>Growing up gaming sparked my interest in IT. I have always liked taking the time to notice and think about all the different technologies around me in my everyday life. I like seeing new technologies and how they work together and what that can do for the world and me individually.<br><br>

              I have wanted to study IT for a while but did not know where to start. My brother is studying the same course at RMIT, so he convinced me to apply too. I applied through open universities same as him.<br><br>

              I expect to gain a more in depth understanding of IT and hopefully find what interests me the most about IT. I plan to use this as a steppingstone to finding a career in IT once I know what I like the most.</p>

							<h4>What do the results of the tests mean to me</h4>
							<p>The Myers-Briggs test on 16personalities.com tells me I am a turbulent logician. The logician personality is a rare type that involves abstract thinking, open-mindedness, and being honest and straightforward. The turbulent aspect of this type is one that is generally less satisfied with accomplishments and more likely to make decisions they regret. As I read about the common traits in logicians the more I believe the test to be accurate. It states logicians are relaxed and happy with people they are close to and those who share their interests. However, they can become quite shy around unfamiliar people.</p>

							<h4>How I think the results may influence my behaviour in a team</h4>
							<p>Being told I have a personality that is known to be shut off and shy when with new people I believe I would maybe try harder to be less shy. However, I may not be able to control my shy nature and so not involve myself in much discussion. I think my behaviour will be that of a follower rather than a leader in a group. Being an auditory learner, I think I would be better off with someone explaining things to me rather than reading. Therefore, I may be better off doing group work than work on my own as I will have someone to listen to.</p>

							<h4>How will I take this into account when forming a team</h4>
							<p>I believe having an INTP-T personality would mean I would be better placed in a group with someone I know or who has similar interests to me. This would make it easier for me to be more open about ideas and criticisms than with someone of a different personality type. However, I also believe as having a turbulent personality I would be better suited with a person how is more assertive and not afraid to lead as I may hesitate to make suggestions. Therefore, I believe forming a group with someone who is a natural leader would be preferable for me. </p>
