						<h3>About The Job</h3>

						<p>Being a network engineet involves making and implementing network solutions to different clients. This includes building wireless networks and firewalls. I find it appealing as I have stated above that I enjoy seeing how technologies work together to benefit an individual or company. This would allow me to implement the best solution I can for a client.</p>

						<h3>Necessary Skills, Qualifications and Experience=</h3>

						<p>This job does require at least 3 yearsâ€™ experience in a network engineering position. With this requirement would also come with experience in wireless networks and firewall security which the job also requires.  This means I would need to complete a network engineering course, more likely a cybersecurity course to get into a network engineering job. This job just happens to require the previous experience. This job would require skills like time management, leadership but also working well on your own. It would also be good to have people skills if there is a need to interact with the client of a job. </p>

						<h3>My Skills, Qualifications and Experience</h3>

						<p>My current qualifications consist of completion of the HSC and a certificate III in retail. Which means I have a long way to go before I have the required qualifications of a network engineer. I believe I have some skills/traits that would potentially be needed in this career. Such as, working well with people and being able to work on my own. In my opinion I must develop my leadership and time management skills some more before I would be best suited for the career.</p>

						<h3>My Plan</h3>

						<p>My plan to obtain the qualifications will be to finish a course at Uni and complete another, more specialised course of cybersecurity. This will give me the necessary qualifications to get into an initial position as a network engineer. To gain the skills necessary I believe finishing the necessary courses will develop my time management skills as that is a must have for doing study. My leadership skill I believe I can develop through reading and putting myself into situations where I can lead. I will have to find something to take me out of my comfort zone to learn how to take charge. </p>
