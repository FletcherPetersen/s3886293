					<h2>Day Organiser</h2>

					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>My project idea is a day oragniser application that will be connected to multiple devices. User can enter the times of the day that they are occupied with work, study, sports, or other activities. The app will then not only alert when a person needs to prepare for/do the things they have entered, but also calculate time in between what has been entered for the day that the person has available to do other activities. This is great for people like me who find themselves disorganised and struggling to find time to even make dinner. The app would also periodically remind a person to find time to relax, or if they have a partner to maybe spend a bit of time with that person.</p>

					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>My motivation for this project is to help people like me who are not organised daily. There is a plethora of books, articles and videos created to help people become more organised. My goal for this project is to help people take things day by day, even hour by hour, to find more time in the day to get small things done. I believe focusing on getting small tasks done will make people feel more accomplished and contribute in a big way to them feeling organised. </p>

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The app will be a product aiming to help people organise their daily lives. It will feature a system where people can enter the things occupying certain times of the day. This will either be in the form of a table separated into intervals. Or as a kind of menu that people can select times on a drop-down list. They may also enter things like their age, sex, location, whether they have a partner, hobbies etc. This information will then be collated and stored either internally or on a cloud storage system. The app will use the stored information to alert users of what is upcoming for the day. Alerts will be able to be turned on or off for different thing. For example, if a person does not want to get notified for work if they do the same shift weekly, they will be able to turn off notifications for work. Also, the amount of time before the event/task a person wants to be alerted will be adjustable so they can have lots of notice for things that require getting ready or travel. They could also have a notification just before the event if it is close. If the same person in the above example instead, wanted to use the notification as an alarm to wake up to they would also be able to change the alert to suit. <br><br>

					Not only will the app alert people when they need to complete the events entered in the system, but also find time for people to do other activities in their downtime. The app will take the empty space between entered information and determine what could be useful for the person to focus on in the meantime. This could be anywhere from making dinner after work, to study, to just reminding the person to relax. These extra events that the app uses to alert people can either be entered by the person, as explained above, or be determined by existing suggestions in the app’s files. This allows people a way to not get distracted by things on their phone and waste time.<br><br>

					Finally, the app will also have a connect option to allow people to make plans in an effective way. A person will be able to choose the people they are able to initiate and receive plans from. Once people are connected, one party may initiate a plan to meet up or go to an event together. If it lines up with the other person’s available times of the day, they will get a notification asking if they would like to accept the event. If they accept, the event will be automatically added to both people’s schedules. If the requested time is already occupied with another event on either parties’ schedules, then they will be asked if they would like to change their other events. If the receiving party chooses to not change their schedule or denies the event the other person will be notified. There will be a limit to event initiations to prevent spam.</p>


					<h3>Tool And Technologies</h3>
					<p>The app will need to be programmed and available on smartphones and other devices. I would need to find a suitable programming language to use to develop this app. Also, graphical design will be important for the app to stand out. To have the option of connecting to other apps to increase the capability of the app I would need to use something like IFTTT. Storage of entered data would most likely be internal unless the app is to be able to link with friends and other apps. If that is the case, then cloud storage may be necessary to interlink people and other apps. The app would also obviously have to be published on the app store and google play for it to be available to the consumer.</p>

					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>Programming will be the major skill required in this project as it will be the foundations of this app. I would need to learn how to program the app as I have not done a lot of programming in the past. Graphical design is also an area that I do not have experience in so I would either get help from someone who has experience in that area or learn myself. Being able to make alerts that can be implemented into the app is also another skill that will be required. I would need a way to monetize the project otherwise it will struggle to stay updated and maintain the option of cloud storage and connectivity. I would also need a way to get the app out there so it can have a consumer base.</p>

					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If this project is successful, I believe it will give people the chance to make their lives more productive. Whether it is being productive by focusing on their projects that can change the world, or just having dinner ready early and things prepared for the next day. The impact will be dependent on the individual who is using the app. However, using the connection service the app will have, it will allow the potential for better planning for events between friends, colleagues, and partners.</p>
